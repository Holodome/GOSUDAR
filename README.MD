# GOSUDAR

Game written in C++ mostly as an educational project.
The goal is to create game from scratch while using minimal libraries, including the standart one.

## Compiling and running

Compiling is done in minimalistic way, using batch files.
To compile run tools\build.bat for debug build or tools\build_release.bat for release
To run game simply call executable located in the game directory
Game needs asset file to function, which should be located in the same directory as an executable

## Inspiration

This project is hugely inspired by the handmade hero series https://handmadehero.org/
